============

Sample Repo to play around with learning Git

There are some branches available with build in commits that serve different purposes.

* simple-feature-branch - branch off master with 0 conflicts

* merge-conflicts-rebase - branch off master with merge conflicts, practice rebasing

* feature-branching - branch off of the "simple-feature-branch" branch. Practice rebasing on top of the feature branch instead of master.
